title: "$1 Million Per Week: My Seven-Week AI Development Sprint"
---

## üöÄ Introduction

In just seven weeks, I delivered what traditional estimates value at **$7.8 million** ‚Äì that's over **$1 million of software every single week** ‚Äì using Anthropic's Claude Code as my co-developer.

Total cash spent? **$636.**

As an engineer with 10 years of experience, I've always had a backlog of project ideas that seemed too time-consuming to execute. When Claude Code launched, I saw an opportunity to test a hypothesis: could an experienced engineer use AI tools to rapidly execute complex technical ideas while maintaining high quality standards?

Working 10-14 hours per day for seven weeks, I systematically designed, managed, and have built over half a dozen projects in the last 2 months. Each project started with a real problem I wanted to solve, required detailed system architecture, and demanded careful management of AI agents to stay on track. The result: 219,400 lines of production-quality code across domains from AI orchestration to secure clipboard synchronization.

This post is for technical founders, engineers, and leaders curious about AI-driven development. It's not a story about AI replacing engineering - it's about what becomes possible when skilled engineering leadership is amplified by AI implementation tools. You'll learn how I structured projects for AI development, managed quality at scale, and achieved unprecedented capital efficiency for technical entrepreneurs.

## üîß My Strategic Use of AI Tools

After three years of using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude Code allowed me to seamlessly integrate AI into my developer workflow. Here's how I leveraged it strategically:

### 1. Implementation Acceleration, Not Ideation

Every project started with a real problem I wanted to solve. I used ChatGPT and Claude desktop apps to refine ideas and generate detailed markdown specifications, but the core concepts came from my 10 years of engineering experience. AI accelerated implementation of my designs, not the creative process.

My main focus throughout this sprint was Guild Framework - my vision for the fastest, most capable, cost-optimized, and intuitive AI research and development tool on the market. Guild is designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents working together on complex software projects, and it's now in final integration and UX refinement after over-achieving its initial goals.

To minimize risk to Guild's core architecture while maximizing learning, I built multiple smaller projects as testing grounds. This strategy was deliberate - each project helped me discover patterns, refine workflows, and identify gaps in existing AI development tools.

For example:

- **Claude-Code-Go SDK** Released a fully featured golang sdk to wrap claude code cli sdk less than a week after the sdk update
- **AlgoScales** helped me refine the ai_docs process, keeping planning docs in a main repo and using submodules for code.
- **tree2scaffold** Initial project I used CLI AI tools to build, which hooked me on claude code after a terrible experience with openai codex cli.
- **Youtube Summarizer** Tool I built to extract content discussed in youtube videos that I needed for agent context.

Each project helped me refine my AI agent development process and identify gaps in currently available tools. These insights directly informed Guild's design, ensuring it addresses real pain points I experienced firsthand. Guild is becoming the tool I wished existed when I started this journey - one that makes multi-agent AI development as intuitive and productive as possible.

### 2. Research Amplification

I developed a systematic research process using multiple AI tools:

- **ChatGPT, Claude and Grok Deep Research**: Generated detailed markdown documents with inline sources
- **Web search**: Found competitors and libraries doing similar work
- **Youtube**: Extracted content from youtube videos via my youtube summarizer tool to add context for planning that wasn't available outside of a handful of youtube videos

This research fed into detailed specifications stored in `ai_docs/` directories that Claude Code agents could reference, ensuring implementations aligned with proven patterns.

### 3. Quality Control Through AI Management

The key insight: AI tools are powerful but require careful management. I developed a systematic approach:

- **Detailed specifications**: Every feature was documented in markdown before implementation
- **Modular architecture**: Designed systems so agents could work on isolated components
- **Test-driven development**: Required 100% test coverage and behavior-focused tests
- **Constant course-correction**: Used markdown checklists and explicit coding standards

This wasn't hands-off development - it required active engineering leadership to keep AI agents productive and on-track. It required hundreds of markdown planning documents, with regular iteration and several large scale code refactors, active monitoring of the code agents were writing and what they were doing.

**Guild Framework** ($5.25M COCOMO value)
_Tech Stack: Go, gRPC, SQLite_
_Purpose: Multi-agent AI orchestration framework_

The crown jewel of this sprint and my primary focus. Guild is positioned to be the fastest, most capable, cost-optimized, and intuitive AI research and development tool on the market. It's a complete enterprise-grade platform that orchestrates multiple AI agents working together on complex software projects.

Guild has over-achieved its initial goals and is now in the final integration and UX refinement phase. The medieval metaphor runs deep: AI agents become "Artisans," projects are "Guilds," and tasks are "Commissions." This isn't superficial theming - it's a conceptual framework that makes complex multi-agent systems intuitive to design and manage.

**Technical Sophistication:**

- **151,315 lines of Go code** (with an additional 95,366 lines of planning documentation)
- **6-Layer Prompt Architecture**: With dynamic composition
- **Production Chat Interface**: TUI with streaming responses syntax highlighting, multi-agent chat through 1 interface
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Build guilds of agents using OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, DeepSeek, Deepinfra, Ora or claude-code
- **Advanced Tool System**: Complete workspace isolation for safe agent execution, with tools for code analysis, git operations, LSP integration, web scraping and efficient code navigation
- **Enterprise Infrastructure**: gRPC bidirectional streaming, SQLite with type-safe SQLC queries, registry pattern for extensibility, and sophisticated error handling with stack traces
- **MCP Client And Server**: Support for connecting to MCP servers, or using guild as an MCP server
- **Human Readable Local RAG**: ChromemGo RAG system with human readable knowledge base feature

**Engineering Challenges I Overcame:**

- Designed a novel prompt layering system that allows runtime configuration without restarts
- Built a complete multi-agent orchestration system where specialized agents collaborate on complex tasks
- Implemented comprehensive tool isolation to safely execute agent-generated commands
- Created a production-ready chat interface that rivals commercial AI applications
- Developed a sophisticated corpus/RAG system using ChromemGo for intelligent documentation retrieval

Guild demonstrates what's possible when an experienced engineer directs AI implementation. The framework required constant management to maintain enterprise patterns like proper context passing and error handling across its massive codebase. This is the kind of project that traditionally requires a team of senior engineers and months of development - I built it in weeks by combining my system design experience with AI's implementation speed.

**AlgoScales** ($811K COCOMO value)
_Tech Stack: Go, Lua, Vim Script_
_Purpose: Algorithm practice tool with AI hints_

An algorithm practice tool that applies musical education principles to coding interview prep. Features AI-powered hints, Vim integration, and a unique "scales" metaphor for learning patterns. The cross-language integration showcased Claude's polyglot capabilities.

## üí∞ COCOMO vs. Reality

> **TLDR** I produced over **$1 million per week** of software value for seven straight weeks. Traditional COCOMO values my 219,400 lines of executable code at **$7.8M**. When including 126K lines of planning documentation, the total project value reaches **$12.7M**. Actual cost: **$636** in AI subscriptions.

### What COCOMO Means

The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) estimates software development effort based on lines of code. For my projects, it shows two perspectives:

**Executable Code (219,400 lines):**

- **Cost**: $7,760,572 in development expenses
- **Time**: 29.96 months with a full team
- **Team Size**: 23.01 developers working concurrently

**Including Planning Documentation (351,393 total lines):**

- **Cost**: $12,725,591 in development expenses
- **Time**: 36.16 months with a full team
- **Team Size**: 31.27 developers working concurrently

Both estimates demonstrate the dramatic leverage AI provides. Even the conservative code-only estimate shows over \$7.7M in traditional development costs ‚Äì equivalent to a **\$1M weekly burn rate** compressed into one engineer's workstation.

### Actual Cost

My seven-week sprint cost exactly:

- **Claude Max**: $400 (2 months subscription)
- **ChatGPT Pro**: $200 (1 month)
- **ChatGPT Plus**: $20 (1 month)
- **X Premium**: $16 (2 months for Grok research)
- **Total**: $636

**Time Investment**: 10-14 hours per day, 6-7 days per week for 7 weeks (plus 1 week of 2-3 hours per day while attending a startup conference)

### Efficiency Ratio

**Based on Executable Code (\$7.8M):**

- **Cost efficiency**: 12,200x reduction (\$7.8M ‚Üí \$636)
- **Time efficiency**: 15x acceleration (29.96 months ‚Üí 2 months)
- **Team efficiency**: 23x productivity multiplier (23.01 developers ‚Üí 1 developer + AI)

**Including Planning Documentation (\$12.7M):**

- **Cost efficiency**: 20,000x reduction (\$12.7M ‚Üí \$636)
- **Time efficiency**: 18x acceleration (36.16 months ‚Üí 2 months)
- **Team efficiency**: 31x productivity multiplier (31.27 developers ‚Üí 1 developer + AI)

Either way, the numbers represent a paradigm shift in software development economics. I maintained the equivalent of a **$1 million per week development velocity** as a solo engineer with AI tools.

### What This Means for Technical Entrepreneurs

These numbers represent a fundamental shift in what's possible for bootstrapped technical projects:

**Capital Requirements Collapse** - Complex software that previously required significant funding can now be built for the cost of a few AI subscriptions. The barrier to entry for technical entrepreneurs has dropped dramatically.

**Speed to Market** - Ideas can be validated and built in weeks rather than quarters. This enables rapid experimentation and iteration cycles that weren't economically viable before.

**Solo Founder Viability** - Technical founders can now build MVP versions of complex products single-handedly. You no longer need to choose between technical depth and speed - you can have both.

**Focus on Unique Value** - Instead of spending months on implementation basics, engineers can focus on the unique value propositions that differentiate their products.

However, this isn't "no-code" - it requires significant engineering expertise to direct AI effectively and maintain quality at scale.

## üîç My AI Agent Management System

The secret wasn't just prompt engineering - it was developing a systematic approach to managing AI agents across complex, multi-month projects. Here's the workflow I evolved:

### Project Structure for AI Development

This structure evolved from experimentation with multiple projects. I've found that as projects grow it's incredibly important to keep documentation up to date or archive it because if it gets too messy, agents may re-implement something you've moved away from.

### Task Breakdown Process

Before any coding, I would:

1. **Research and spec** the problem using ChatGPT/Claude/Grok
2. **Design the architecture** based on my experience and research
3. **Break down implementation** into markdown files with checkboxes
4. **Create coding standards** specific to the project requirements
5. **Set up testing strategy** with behavior-focused test requirements

For example, with Guild, I explicitly required agents to check for Golang context passing and custom error handlers in every task prompt because they consistently missed these enterprise patterns.

### Quality Control Through Encouragement

I discovered an unexpected insight: Claude 4 Opus performs significantly better with positive reinforcement. When I included phrases like "You're doing a great job" and "I believe in you" in prompts, the AI would tackle difficult problems instead of taking shortcuts. Claude 4 Sonnet doesn't have this problem and generally does what you expect it to do without extra encouragement.

Without encouragement, Claude 4 Opus would often make tests pass rather than fix the underlying code - essentially gaming the metrics rather than solving the problem and then would apologize for trying to trick me when confronted.

### Context Management at Scale

For large projects like Guild (>150k LOC), I used:

- **Excessive markdown documentation** - Over-documented everything so agents could work without full project context
- **Modular architecture** - Designed systems so agents could focus on isolated components
- **Constant re-referencing** - Constantly reminded agents to review documents via `@ai_docs/specdoc.md` in chat
- **Planning document archival** - Prevented agents from referencing stale documentation

### Real Management Examples

Here's how I directed an agent for Blockhead.Consulting's custom systems:

```text
Task: Implement git-based encrypted form submission system

Context: Check ai_docs/planning/form_security.md for encryption requirements
Standards: Follow ai_docs/references/golang_enterprise_patterns.md
Testing: Ensure 100% test coverage, tests should verify behavior not implementation

Specific requirements:
- Use Go context throughout the call chain
- Implement custom error handling as defined in error_patterns.md
- Encrypt form data before git commit
- Include timezone handling for all timestamps

After completion:
1. Run tests and verify they test expected behavior
2. Check code against golang_enterprise_patterns.md
3. Move task file to ai_docs/archived/ with completion timestamp
4. Update CLAUDE.md with any new patterns discovered

You're doing excellent work on this project. I believe in your ability to implement this securely and efficiently.
```

This level of detail was necessary to maintain quality while working on 3-5 projects simultaneously.

## üåü What I Learned About AI-Assisted Development

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

**Parallel Project Development** - AI enabled me to work on 3-5 projects simultaneously, something impossible with traditional development. I could switch between AlgoScales, Guild, and ClipSync throughout the day, maintaining context through detailed documentation.

**Implementation Speed for Known Patterns** - Once I had researched and architected a solution, AI could implement it remarkably quickly. Systems that would require multiple full time developers months or years, are done or nearly done, and many were worked on in parallel. I've launched multiple open source projects while building Guild.

**Quality Through Process, Not AI Magic** - The high code quality came from my systematic approach: detailed specs, modular architecture, test-driven development, and constant review. AI was fast, but quality required engineering discipline.

### The Real Challenges

**AI Laziness with Complex Problems** - Claude Opus would sometimes take shortcuts on difficult tasks, making tests pass rather than fixing underlying issues. This required active management and positive reinforcement to overcome.

**Enterprise Patterns Require Explicit Teaching** - AI consistently missed patterns common in enterprise environments but rare in training data (like Go context passing and custom error handlers). I had to explicitly check for these in every prompt.

**Debugging Still Requires Human Expertise** - Guild's complexity led to challenging debugging sessions that AI couldn't handle alone. The modular architecture I designed was essential for isolating problems that AI could then help solve.

**Context Management is Critical** - Large projects like Guild required excessive documentation and careful context management. Success depended on my ability to design systems that AI could understand in pieces.

### Unexpected Insights

**Documentation Becomes Everything** - In AI-assisted development, documentation isn't just helpful - it's the primary interface for directing AI behavior. I spent significant time on specs, standards, and process documentation.

**Positive Reinforcement Matters** - Including encouragement in prompts dramatically improved AI performance on difficult tasks. This psychological aspect wasn't something I expected to matter.

**Traditional Team Structures Need Rethinking** - AI tools enable individual engineers to deliver what previously required teams. The biggest challenge for organizations will be restructuring work assignments, not the technology itself.

**From Developer to Engineering Director** - I found myself functioning more as an engineering director than a developer, focusing on vision and architecture rather than implementation details. My extensive software experience let me direct AI agents efficiently, but the day-to-day work shifted to strategic thinking and quality oversight.

**Development Becomes Fun Again** - AI eliminated the boring parts of software development. I got into software to build cool things, but the coolest ideas were usually too complex for one person to realistically achieve. Now I can tackle ambitious projects and see significant progress daily - AI essentially gamified development for me. Instead of months before having something significant, I had working demos within days.

## üôè Conclusion

Over seven weeks, I built eight complex software products by myself for \$636. That's **\$1 million worth of software delivered every single week** according to traditional estimates ‚Äì \$7.8M for 219,400 lines of executable code. This velocity demonstrates a fundamental shift in what's possible for technical entrepreneurs.

The key insight is that experienced engineers can now build complex, niche software products extremely fast with minimal capital. These aren't simple CRUD apps - Guild is a sophisticated AI orchestration framework, AlgoScales integrates multiple languages with AI assistance, and Blockhead.Consulting features custom-built business systems that would typically require multiple SaaS integrations.

Success with AI-assisted development requires significant engineering expertise. Every project demanded careful architecture, systematic AI management, debugging skills, and quality control processes. The tools amplify engineering capability - they don't replace engineering judgment.

For the industry, this means rethinking fundamental assumptions about team size, development timelines, and capital requirements. Individual engineers can now tackle projects that previously required entire teams. Companies need to restructure how they assign work to take advantage of this productivity shift rather than simply trying to reduce headcount.

Most importantly, the barrier to launching technical products has shifted from capital and team size to vision and engineering skill. If you're a technical entrepreneur with ambitious ideas, the tools to build them efficiently exist today.

Guild Framework, my primary focus throughout this sprint, is approaching its first public release. After over-achieving its initial goals, it's ready to help other engineers orchestrate multi-agent AI systems with the same patterns that enabled my productivity. This tool embodies everything I learned about making AI development intuitive and productive.

What will you build with this leverage?

If you're a technical leader looking to achieve similar results ‚Äì whether you're a startup founder racing to market, an enterprise architect modernizing legacy systems, or a consultant delivering complex projects ‚Äì I can show you how to harness AI tools strategically while maintaining engineering excellence.
